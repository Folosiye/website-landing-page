<h2> History of HTML </h2> 

<br> 

<h2> What is HTML? </h2> 

<br><p> HTML also known as HyperText Markup Language is the language for making the structure of websites.  

<br>HTML was presented to the world back in 1989 by its creator, Tim Berners-Lee.  

<br>It was made for physicists so they could work and share their work with each other. </p> <br>

<h4> HTML 2.0 </h4>  

 

<!-- Paragraph -->  


<p1> HTML 2.0 is the second installation of the HTML series, it was created in 1995 and was published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).   

<br>HTML 2.0 had all the features 1.0 had. It was used as the standard until 1997. HTML 2.0 had all the features 1.0 had. It was used as the standard until 1997. </p1> 

         

<br>  

<br> 

 

 

<h4> HTML 3.0 </h4> 

 

 

 

<p1> HTML 3.0 was built on HTML 2.0, a company called Netscape which was the leading browser of the time, wrote and introduced new tags and attributes to its browser  

<br>which allowed HTML authors to have better looking design, unfortunately these tags didn’t work on other browsers  

<br>so the websites looked very bad, that’s when the leader of a HTML working group called Dave Raggett made a new HTML 3.0 draft  

<br>which allowed HTML authors to make better design for their webpages no matter the browser, HTML 3.0 did not last very long as browsers were very slow at implementing it. </p1> 

<br> 

<br> 

<!-- Sub Heading -->  

<h4> HTML 3.2 </h4>  

<p> HTML 3.2, code-named “WILBUR”, was released officially in January 1997, it was published as the W3C Recommendation and adopted by many browsers like Netscape and Microsoft.  

<br>HTML 3.2 included features like tables, applets, text flow around images, subscripts and superscripts.  

<br>HTML 3.2 was made mainly because of new tags that were being introduced by browsers like Netscape. </p1> 

<br> 

<br> 

<!-- Sub Heading -->  

<h4> HTML 4.01 </h4>  

 

<!-- Paragraph -->  

 

<p> HTML 4.01, code-named “COUGAR”, was released officially in April of 1998, it had a new feature called Cascading Style Sheets, also known as CSS.  

<br>This feature allowed people to easily change a websites text, font, colour and background because the website and the style sheets were now separated.  

<br>Microsoft’s Explorer implemented the tags very quickly which made the websites look very good, Netscape on the other hand did not implement them. </p1> 

                  

<br>  

<br> 

 

<!-- Sub Heading -->  

<h4> HTML5 </h4>  

 

 

 

<p1> HTML5 first came out on 28 October 2014. HTML5 offers new tags and new features to give you as much tools as possible to create or fulfil  

<br>your purpose of using HTML5 without the use of other programs or software.  

<br>HTML5 Is supported by many web browsers such as Firefox, internet explorer, Google chrome, Safari, Microsoft edge and many more.</p1>

<h2> History of CSS </h2>

<h2> What is CSS? </h2> 

 

<p> CSS, also known as Cascading Style Sheets, is a Style Sheet language for HTML,  

<br>CSS was made to make webpage editing easier by allowing the author to make the website and design change separated.  </p>

<h4> CSS 1.0 </h4> 

<p> CSS was released in December 1996, CSS was the new big thing for HTML authors, it allowed them to make more improved website designs and colouring.  

<br>It was recommended by the W3C that same year to be used when creating webpages. The language at the time was simple visual formatting model for HTML.   

<br> 

It introduced changes to:  

<br> 

1. Foreground and Background colour images  

<br> 

2. Font properties such as typeface  

<br> 

3. Text including word and letter spacing  

<br> 

4. Margins and Padding  

<br> 

5. Classifications and Alignment  

 </p> 

 <br> 

 <br> 

<h4> CSS 2.0 </h4> 

<p> This standard of CSS was built to enhance the current properties of CSS 1.0, the draft was released in November 1997 and became a W3C recommendation May 1998.  

<br>This version of CSS brought dynamic changes to the content with effects such as Hover and Shadow effect and added styles for other media types so they can be used for page layout designing.  </p> 

<br> 

<br> 

<h4> CSS 2.1 </h4> 

<p> CSS 2.0 did not remain the recommended standard by the W3C as CSS 2.1 was introduced in and recommended in June 2011. 

<br> CSS2.1 was more complex than its predecessor. “It gave web designers the ability to define multiple class names on a given element 

<br> and a first take on responsive design: The font-size-adjust property. 

<br> You could now also fit your fonts and other requirements to the device you were holding which included braille, vicsal printers and aural devices. These were the first glimpses of CSS 3"(Smart Mentors, 2019).  </p> 

<br> 

<br> 

<h4> CSS 3.0 </H4> 

<p> CSS 3.0 was released On June 7th, 2011. CSS 3.0 was made to extend the abilities of CSS2.1. CSS3.0 was introduced, to style html elements with not as much effort or code. 

<br>"CSS3 is backwards-compatible with former CSS versions. It means that CSS3 features work on web pages using older CSS.  

<br>Browsers that support CSS2 also represent the modifications with CSS3. It took nine years for CSS Level 2 to gain the Recommendation status because some features delayed the specification.  

<br>To speed up this process, CSS Working Group divided CSS into more convenient parts referred to as modules".  </p>

<h4> Differences between CSS 1.0, CSS 2.0 and CSS 3.0 </H4> 

<P> 

1. CSS was originally released in 1996 and consists of properties for adding font properties such as typeface and emphasis colour of text, backgrounds, and other elements.  

<br>CSS2 was released in 1998 with added styles for other media types so that it can be used for page layout designing.  

<br>CSS3 was released in 1999 and presentation-style properties were added in it that allows you to build a presentation from documents.  

<br> 

<br> 

2. Unlike CSS2, which was comprised of a single document, CSS3 has its specifications divided into many individual modules, which makes CSS3 a whole lot easier to handle. 

<br> 

<br> 

3. With CSS3, the designers can now use special fonts, like those available in Google Fonts and Typecast.  

<br>Earlier, with CSS and CSS2, designers could only use “web-safe fonts” for being 100% sure to use fonts that would always display the same on every machine.  

<br> 

<br> 

4. While CSS and CSS2 had ‘simple selectors’, CSS3 calls the components as a sequence of simple selectors.  

<br> 

<br> 

5. CSS3 came up with some key web design considerations like rounded borders that help in rounding up the borders without any hassle.  

<br>This turned out to be a huge plus point for developers who were struggling with initial versions of CSS borders.  

<br> 

<br> 

6. CSS3 has the capability to split text sections into multiple columns so that it can be read like a newspaper.  

<br>In CSS2, the developers had difficulty because the standard was not equipped with automatically breaking the text so that it fits within a box.
